  * Catalog of grammars
    * 0-type grammar (Phrase grammar or grammar without limitation)
      * to any production $\alpha\rightarrow\beta$ in P $(\alpha\in V^+,\beta\in V^*)$ ,there is at least  a non-terminal symbol in $\alpha$
    * 1-type grammar (context-sensitive grammar or length-added grammar)
      * to any production $\alpha\rightarrow\beta$ in P, there is the limitation of $|\beta|\ge|\alpha|$ **expect for $S\rightarrow\epsilon$,if $S\rightarrow\epsilon$, S can not appear in the right side for any production.
      * for any production $\alpha\rightarrow\beta$ in P, $\alpha A\beta\rightarrow\alpha\gamma\beta\ (\alpha,\beta\in V^*)$ expect for $S\rightarrow\epsilon$
    * 2-type grammar (context-free grammar)
      * Every production in P is of the form $A\rightarrow\beta$ where $A\in V_N,\beta\in V^*$
    * 3-type grammar (Regular grammar, right-linear grammar or left-linear grammar)
      * Every production in P is of the form $A\rightarrow\alpha B,A\rightarrow\alpha$, or $A\rightarrow B\alpha$,$A\rightarrow\alpha$,where $A$,$B\in V_N,\alpha\in V_T^*$
* Grammar Simplification
  * delete productions like $P\rightarrow P$
  * delete productions who can not be used in the derivations
  * delete productions who can not derive a terminal string
* Construct context-free grammar without Œµ-production
  * it should follow conditions as followings
    * If there is the production S‚ÜíŒµ of the form in P, S should not appear in right-side of any production, where S is the start symbol of the grammar;
    * There are no other Œµ-productions in P
  * How to construct
    * $G=(V_N,V_T,P,S)\rightarrow G'=(V'_N,V'_T,P',S')$
    * find out all non-terminal symbols that can derive Œµ after some steps, and put them into the set $V_0$
    *   construct the P‚Äôs set of productions of G‚Äô as following steps:
      1. If an symbol in $V_0$ appears in the right side of a production, change the production into two production respectively; put the new productions into P
      2. put the productions relating to the symbol into P‚Äô except for Œµ-production relating to the symbol
      3. if there exists the production of the form $S\rightarrow \epsilon$ in P,change the production into $S‚Äô\rightarrow \epsilon |S$ and put them into  $P‚Äô$,let $S‚Äô$ be the start symbol of $G‚Äô$, let $V‚Äô_N=V_N\cup \{S'\}$

# Chapter 3 Lexical analysis

## Approaches to implement a lexical analyzer

* Simple approach

  * Construct a diagram that illustrates the structure of the tokens of the source language , and then to hand-translate the diagram into a program for finding tokens

    >  Efficient lexical analyzers can be produced in this manner

* Pattern-directed programming approach

  * Pattern Matching technique

  * Specify and design program that execute actions triggered by patterns in strings

  * Introduce a pattern-action language called Lex for specifying lexical analyzers

    - Patterns are specified by regular expressions
- A compiler for Lex can generate an efficient finite automation recognizer for the regular expressions
  
* First phase of a compiler

  1. Main task

     * To read the input characters 
     * To produce a sequence of tokens used by the parser for syntax analysis
     * As an assistant of parser

  2. Interaction of lexical analyzer with parser

3. „ÄÅProcesses in lexical analyzers

   *„ÄÄScanning
     *„ÄÄPre-processing
       * Strip out comments and white space
       * Macro functions
   *„ÄÄCorrelating error messages from compiler with source program
     *„ÄÄA line number can be associated with an error message
   *„ÄÄLexical analysis

4. Terms of the lexical analyzer

   1. Token 
      * Types of words in source program
      * Keywords, operators, identifiers, constants, literal strings, punctuation symbols(such as commas,semicolons)
   2. Lexeme
      1. Actual words in source program
   3. Pattern
      1. A rule describing the set of lexemes that can represent a particular token in source program
      2. **Relation** {<.<=,>,>=,==,<>}

5. Attributes for Token

   1. A pointer to the symbol-table entry in which the information about the token is kept

   >  E.g E=M*C**2

    <**id**, pointer to symbol-table entry for E>

    <**assign_op**,>

   <**id**, pointer to symbol-table entry for M>

   <**multi_op**,>

   <**id**, pointer to symbol-table entry for C>

   <**exp_op**,>

   <**num**,integer value 2>
   
6. Lexical Errors

    *   Deleting an extraneous character
    *   Inserting a missing character
    *   Replacing an incorrect character by a correct character
    *   Transposing two adjacent characters(such as , fi=>if)
    *   Pre-scanning 

7.  Input Buffering
    *   Two-buffer input scheme to look ahead on the input and identify tokens
    *   Buffer pairs
    *   Sentinels(Guards)
